# Loggy
Loggy is used to view logs created by the Unreal Engine. The goal is to create a proper view for logs to organize them in a clear way for better debugging. 

## How do I use it?
When you started the application, you paste the path to the folder which contains all the log files. After pasting and analyzing the folder, you can see all log files contained in the folder as panels. When you want to investigate one, you just click on it!
